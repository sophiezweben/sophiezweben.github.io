        <h1>Projects</h1>
        <p class="lead">The school I attend, The New School, believes strongly in project based learning, especially while helping out our community. Throughout the year we particupate in a series of different projects, each one different from the last. In our projects we use the skills gathered from our core classes, and implement them into our day to day lives. <br></p>

        <h2>Project 19</h2>
        <p class="infoText"> In Project 19 my classmates and I picked a topic that we were interested in. We started by researching the subject, and then taking that info, and condensing it and then creating a queston that we wished to have answered. Then, we made surveys to hand out to people in person and online that would help us to answer our question. The goal was to get as many responses as possible so that we could get to best end result. After we got all the answers to the surveys, we compiled it. Afterwards we made infographics that displayed the information that we gathered. We tried to use as few pictures as possible and order them in the clearist way possible. In this project I learned how to take data I had found, and order it in a way that is most benificial to the viewer. I also learned some very important lessons when asking random people on the street is they would like to take my survey.</p>

           <p class="zine">
             For the Zine Project my class was seperated into groups. We researched something in Atlanta we were interested in to write an article about. I choose the murals in Atlanta. I went around the city and took pictures of murals I found interesting. Afterwards, I reasearched the artists. I then wrote everything down and formatted it to look how I wanted it to.
